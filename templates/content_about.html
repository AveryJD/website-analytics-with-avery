            Analytics With Avery is my personal online space where I showcase my work in sports analytics, with a special focus on hockey. 
            It's a place where I combine my technical skills, statistical insights, and love for the game to share projects, visualizations, 
            and analysis that explore the numbers behind hockey.

            Here, you can find my blog covering research, trends, and statistical insights in sports, designed to make analytics approachable 
            for fans, fellow analysts, and aspiring data scientists. You can also explore my hockey analytics projects, including my NHL player 
            card project, where I evaluate and rank players based on various attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're here to browse my latest hockey data projects or blog posts, or to follow my journey in the world of sports analytics, 
            I hope you find something interesting, informative, or just fun to dive into.
