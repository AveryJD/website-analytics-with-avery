          <h3>Card Explanation:</h3>
          <p>All attributes are weighted based on the past 3 seasons, with the most recent season being weighted the most.</p>
          <p>Each ranking section has the player's ranking for that attribute (the largest number), 
            the total number of players that qualify for that attribute (the smallest number), 
            and a percentile bar showing the percentage of players that the selected player ranks above in that attribute.
          </p>
          <p>To qualify for rankings, a skater must have played at least 30% of the total games in the season (25 games in an 82 game season),
             a goalie must have played 15% of the total games in the season (13 games in an 82 game season).
          </p>
