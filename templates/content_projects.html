        <h1>NHL Player Cards</h1>

        <p>
          I've created NHL player stat cards that combine advanced analytics, custom models, and clean visuals to highlight player performance.
          You can view over 13,000 individual cards of forwards, defenseman, and goalies from 17 seasons!
          This is still a work in progress, so the rankings and visuals are constantly evolving as I continue improving these cards.

          If you have any feedback or find any bugs/errors, I'd love to hear about it (check out my <a href="/socials">socials</a> to easily contact me).
          You can also explore the code and the behind the scenes of this project and follow its development on my 
          <a href="https://github.com/AveryJD/hockey-player-attribute-rankings-cards" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        <h1>NHL Schedule Genetic Algorithm</h1>
      
        <p>
          This started as my final project for an Evolutionary Computation course and I have since continued to work on it outside the classroom. 
          The goal was to design a genetic algorithm capable of generating optimized NHL schedules under a variety of real-world constraints. 
          The project concluded with a 40 minute formal presentation.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I plan to add more features and visualizations from this project to the website soon, but for now the full source code and documentation is available on
          my <a href="https://github.com/AveryJD/project-nhl-schedule-genetic-algorithm" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

          You can also view the <a href="/static/assets/nhl_schedule_ga_slideshow.pptx" target="_blank">presentation slides</a>.
          These slides were used as a visual aid during the talk and do not represent a complete transcript of the presentation.
