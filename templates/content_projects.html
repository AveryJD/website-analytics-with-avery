        <h1>NHL Player Cards</h1>

        <p>
          I've created NHL player stat cards that combine advanced analytics, custom models, and clean visuals to highlight player performance.
          You can view over 13,000 individual cards of forwards, defenseman, and goalies from 17 seasons!
          This is still a work in progress, so the rankings and visuals are constantly evolving as I continue improving these cards.
